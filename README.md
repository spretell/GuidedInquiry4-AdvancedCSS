# GuidedInquiry4-AdvancedCSS
This fourth guided inquiry consisted of recreations of a checkerboard and American flag with files named accordingly. 
Alongside those recreations, a product site was made which displays a responsive two-row grid. 
All of these projects exemplify CSS, its selectors, and its grid layout.
